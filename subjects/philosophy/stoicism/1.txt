### Stoic Cosmology: The Divine Logos and Eternal Cycles

According to the Stoics, the Universe is a material reasoning substance (logos), which was divided into two classes: the active and the passive.[62] The passive substance is matter itself, while the active substance is an intelligent aether or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter, the logos or *anima mundi* pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the seminal reason ("*logos spermatikos*"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine *logos*, which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.[63] Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs.

Stoicism does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.[64] The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed ("*Ekpyrosis*", conflagration) and re-created again,[65] and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes.
